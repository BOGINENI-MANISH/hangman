1. The Baskerville Curse
The story begins with Dr. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes learning about the infamous curse of the Baskervilles, a legend passed down for generations. According to the tale, Sir Hugo Baskerville, a cruel ancestor, kidnapped a local farmer's daughter. When she escaped across the moor, Sir Hugo chased her down but was killed by a gigantic, spectral hound. Since then, the Baskerville family is said to be haunted by the hound, which brings death to its members.
This chilling tale sets the stage for fear and mystery, with the moor itself being described as a wild and dangerous place, filled with fog, bogs, and eerie howling sounds at night.

2. The Death of Sir Charles
In modern times, Sir Charles Baskerville, the most recent owner of Baskerville Hall, is found dead near the estate. His body shows signs of terror, and gigantic pawprints are discovered nearby. Villagers believe the hound has struck again.
Holmes and Watson are asked to investigate the case when Sir Henry Baskerville, the last living heir, arrives to claim the family estate. Sir Henry, visiting from Canada, receives a mysterious note warning him to stay away from the Baskerville estate, increasing the suspense.

3. Watson’s Journey to Baskerville Hall
Holmes sends Watson to accompany Sir Henry to Baskerville Hall, as Holmes stays behind to secretly investigate. Watson’s role is to observe and report strange occurrences.
Upon arriving at the hall, Watson finds:
•	Barrymore and Mrs. Barrymore, the estate’s servants, behaving suspiciously. They are later revealed to be helping Selden, an escaped convict who is hiding on the moor.
•	The Moors, which are vast, foggy, and treacherous, filled with dangers like the Grimpen Mire, a deadly bog that can swallow anyone who ventures too far.
Watson also hears mysterious howls at night, adding to the fear that the supernatural hound might be real.

4. The Mysterious Jack Stapleton
Watson meets Jack Stapleton, a friendly but peculiar naturalist living near the moor. He seems harmless and introduces Watson to his beautiful sister, Beryl Stapleton, who warns Sir Henry to leave Baskerville Hall. Despite her warning, Sir Henry begins to fall in love with her.
Watson notices strange behavior from Stapleton, including bursts of anger when Sir Henry grows close to Beryl. Suspicion grows around him, but Stapleton hides his true intentions.

5. Holmes Uncovers the Plot
Sherlock Holmes arrives secretly on the moor, working in the shadows while Watson gathers information. Holmes pieces together the mystery:
1.	Jack Stapleton is a distant relative of the Baskervilles, and he stands to inherit the estate if Sir Henry dies.
2.	Stapleton has trained a giant dog, coated in phosphorus to make it glow in the dark, to terrorize and kill his victims.
3.	Stapleton uses the legend of the Baskerville curse to cover up his crimes, making it appear supernatural.

6. The Climax: The Hound Attacks
Holmes and Watson set a trap to catch Stapleton in the act. They follow Sir Henry as he walks across the moor at night. Suddenly, the glowing hound charges at Sir Henry. Its ferocious appearance terrifies him, but Holmes and Watson manage to shoot the hound before it can cause serious harm.
Stapleton flees into the Grimpen Mire, where he presumably dies, sinking into the deadly bog. The case is solved, and the Baskerville curse is revealed to be nothing more than a cover for a cruel, calculated plot.

o	The story explores how fear and legend can obscure logical truths. This ties into tasks where students use AI techniques to uncover facts hidden behind misleading clues.
2.	Tracking and Deduction:
o	Holmes’s tracking of clues mirrors search algorithms like BFS, DFS, and A*.
o	Stapleton’s deception highlights the need for logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction.
3.	Resource Allocation:
o	Holmes and Watson manage resources (time, manpower, and evidence) carefully, linking to CSP tasks.
4.	Adversarial Thinking:
o	Stapleton acts as a cunning adversary, requiring strategic moves to outwit him, similar to adversarial search tasks.

How This Story Prepares Students for the Tasks
1.	Narrative Connection:
o	Students can draw directly from the story when working on tasks, such as exploring the moor (DFS), predicting the hound’s movements (A*), or allocating resources to protect Sir Henry (CSP).
2.	Clues as Data Points:
o	The evidence in the story (pawprints, howls, locations) becomes the input for AI tasks like logic-based deduction or pathfinding.
3.	Dynamic Problem-Solving:
o	Stapleton’s evolving plot and the moor’s dangers mirror real-world scenarios requiring flexible AI strategies.
